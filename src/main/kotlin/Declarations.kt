}

//In the Intellij IDE, the variables z,q and a will be underlined to denote the fact that they are variables of type "var". The "val" variables
//are not underlined. You can see number,n and k without underlines. This distinction is available in IDEs like IntelliJ only. Kotlin
//explicitly does not underline them. Hope you get this important point.

//val keyword is used to declare a constant called q (line 9) which is of type Double.
//Then it sets the value of the constant to the decimal number 1.34

//val keyword is used to declare a constant called x which is of type String (line 7).
//Then it sets the value of the constant to the data string "kotlin"
// = is the assignment operator
