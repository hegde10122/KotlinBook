fun main(){
    //main() is a function denoted by the keyword fun()

    println("Hello World !!")
    //println is also a function
}

//Here the code (the main function) may not reside inside a class like Java. In java all methods reside inside a class.
// Java methods equivalent to Kotlin functions loosely.
