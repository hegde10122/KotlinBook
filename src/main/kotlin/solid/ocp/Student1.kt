/*
 First, the class violates SRP because both the displayResult() and the evaluateDistinction() methods are inside the Student class.
 These two methods are unrelated.

In the future, the exam authority can change the distinction criterion. In this case,
youâ€™ll need to change the evaluateDistinction() method.
Does it solve the problem ? In the current situation, the answer is yes.
But the authority can change the distinction criterion again. This makes retesting the Student class due to the modification of the evaluateDistinction() method

Each time you modify the method, you change the container class as well which means that you need to modify the existing test cases too.

You can also see that every time the distinction criteria changes,
you need to modify the evaluateDistinction() method in the Student class.
So, this class does not follow SRP and it is also not closed for modification.

This problem is solved in the class BetterStudent1.kt
